        <b>What is Meta Tags </b>: Meta tags give short information about the html page to search engines and browser.<br>
        Based on the meta tag search engine can understand about the page and it's content. <br>
        It is most important to provide all meta tags for performing SEO (search engine optimization).<br><br>

        Following are the meta tags <br>
        1. <b> &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; </b><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;This tag is used to declare the character encoding of an HTML document.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The charset attribute specifies the character set used in the document, which is typically UTF-8, a widely used character encoding that can represent almost all characters in the Unicode character set.<br><br>

        2. <b> &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt; </b><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;http-equiv attribute and X-UA-Compatible value is used to specify the version of Internet Explorer (IE) that the web page should be rendered in.The value of IE=edge indicates that the web page should be rendered in the highest version of IE available in the browser, regardless of the version that is being used.<br><br>

        3. <b> &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt; </b><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page, and it varies depending on the device being used. By setting the viewport with this tag, we can make sure that the web page looks good and is properly scaled on all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.The width=device-width attribute sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device, which means the web page will automatically adjust to the size of the device's screen. The initial-scale=1.0 attribute sets the initial zoom level of the web page to 100%, which means the web page will be displayed at its original size when the user first visits the page.<br><br>

        4. <b> &lt;title&gt;Page Titile &lt;title&gt;</b><br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;This tag is used to define the title of the HTML document. It is typically placed within the &lt;head&gt; section of the HTML file and is displayed in the title bar of the web browser when the page is opened. The text inside the &lt;title&gt; tag is also used by search engines as the main title for the page in search results.  <br><br>
